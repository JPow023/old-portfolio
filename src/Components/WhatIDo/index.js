                                Stemming from a foundation in Fine Arts with a focus in ceramics, I've spent a great deal of my adult life studying interactions between user and product. From a young age, I've been a keen observer with endless curiousity and a passion for great design. After professional work experience as a concept artist, and internship experience as a ceramics teacher, I've greatly enjoyed the shift to User Experience and Product Design.

                                With two years of experience in sales and marketing, I'm a quick rapport builder who gets incredibly excited at the mention of business and brand development. Growing up, I was an NBA stat head, which quickly translated into an interest in market/client research, data analysis, and marketing strategy.
